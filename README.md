# Dice Challenge
Create an app to generate random results from single die rolls.

The user will select which type of dice they would like to roll (4, 6, 8, 10, 12,  or 20 sided) and then a random result will be generated. The app will store previous results, which consist of the type of dice used and the result that was rolled. The history will be retained between runs of the app, no interaction with the list is required.

The  UI is a selector to choose the kind of dice to use and a button to roll the die. The result should be displayed prominently. There should also be a list of previous rolls, either on the same screen or on a second screen. As long as those requirements are met, the UI can be extended, modified, or customized as the engineer sees fit.

Considerations:
* One 1 die will be used per roll
* Dice are named by lowercase “d” followed by the number of sides they contain,  ie d4, d6, etc
* App should contain unit tests where appropriate
* Use of a database is recommended but not required
